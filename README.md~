# Kruskal - use the mst.txt file as input for the tree
Kruskal's algorithm is a minimum-spanning-tree algorithm where the algorithm finds an edge of the least possible weight that connects any two trees in the forest. It is a greedy algorithm in graph theory as it finds a minimum spanning tree for a connected weighted graph at each step.
